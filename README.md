# NYTaxiDataset

In this project I have tied to analyse the New York Taxi dataset publicly available at [this link](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).

Analysis have been done only on the data from 2013 to 2015 using ***JULIA*** as it has some supreme features which improves the performances.

The original datasets and the *.jld* files have been removed from the repository as it was too big to upload, however the structure
of the directories have been retained, so that any one interested can download the dataset and place it in the appropriate
directories to obtain the results.

***Instructions to use the code***

* Download and place the dataset (yellow/green) in the directory Yellow_Taxi_Data_2013-15 *(similarly for green part)*

* The intermediate function will produce some *.jld* files which will be stored in Graphs/Saved_Data

* Having placed the dataset properly the rest of the thing should automatically work.

A notebook having all the compilation analysis can be seen [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/udion/NYTaxiDataset/blob/master/Graphs.ipynb)
