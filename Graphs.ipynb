    "The dataset being analysed is a big data set the which is collectively about **~70GB**. The first barrier before doing any analysis was to be able to read the data quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started off by experimenting with the ***DataFrames*** package the output dataframe had all the required properties and was easy to manipulate but the reading of the file took to long also the **DateTime** type was being read as string and extracting information such as time/date using string manipulation only made the process really slow. Hence we switched to ***CSV*** module, it had a better performance in reading the data  but the output dataframe had the type of **NullableArrays**. This was not in our favour as most of the functions to manipulate the dataframes do not work with the  collumns which had **Nullable** type. Hence we wrote a ***type*** which could read a dataframe using ***CSV.read()*** and the convert it into another DataFrame in which columns were tyepe stable and not the **NullableArray**. This gave us overall better performance than using only DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even loading all the data sequentially would have been very time consuming as each file is big enough to take a significant amount of time. This is where the parallel computing feature of **JULIA** comes in handy.We introduced the ***@everywhere*** macros and used ***SharedArrays*** and ***DistributedArrays (DArrays)*** which allows to map the function on different processors of the system and collect output from these parallel process.Hence it helps us to avoid following the sequential order and do it one by one hence we were able to load all the data in about as much time as it takes to load one dataset with maximum loading time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature also helped us to *parallelize* many function which used multiple files for the analysis and plotting of the graph. Also, in one of the analysis we were to cluster the *latitudes and longitudes* we used ***Clustering*** packge for this and used the inbuilt **K-means** function to implement the *k-means algorithm*, we were able to put all the files in parallel for the process of finding the k-means hence were able to save time there too by avoiding the sequential process."
